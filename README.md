#### GeoPackage Tagged Image File Format Lib ####

The [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/) were developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](http://www.bit-sys.com/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

### About ###

[TIFF](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-tiff-java/) is a Java library for reading and writing Tagged Image File Format files. It was primarily created to provide license friendly TIFF functionality to Android applications. Although developed as part of the [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/), this library does not contain GeoPackage functionality and can be used separately.  Implementation is based on the [TIFF specification](https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf) and this JavaScript implementation: https://github.com/constantinius/geotiff.js
